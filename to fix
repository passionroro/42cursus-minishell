quotes : (init.c)
//deal with special cases “ ‘ \\ “ 

redirection.c : 
//setting <i> and <l> after redicert functions!!

redirection cut function : 
fixing the direction to delete (after ‘<‘);

in some cases we don't exit properly the forks :/
for example : unknow command + ctrl_c prints twice probably because two processes come to the sighandler :
--------------
[prompt]$ coucou
bash: /coucou: No such file or directory
[prompt]$
[prompt]$
--------------

we don't want to run dollar_sign_check when the string is inside single quotes (echo '$HOME')
idea : whenever we encounter a dollar, we check if the string attached to the dollar sign exists in the env (echo $PATH). if it's in a double quote, we check until the closing double quote (echo "$P"ATH should check if $P exists. if not, remove $P and the quotes). if it's inside a single quote, don't run the replacing algo (echo '$HOME' only removes the quotes)
don't forger to add $? in the dollar_sign_check

NEW : 
2. check $ and replace with variable (except in single quotes)
3. check and remove quotes in var init

when path is unset, don't forger to print "bash: env: No such file or directory" with error code 127, even when the function is unknown
when command is unknown and the path is set, "bash: cocou: command not found" error code 127

to send all the error messages in the program to the stderr(2).
there's a function called write_error in utils_built_in.c that takes 4 parameters:
the first 3 are strings to print in stderr, and the 4th is the int the fuction returns.

the fuction always frees the 2nd string sent to it so if you want to print 2 strings without freeing any you send like this : write_error(str1, NULL, str2, ret_int)

there's no other way to do it if we dont want leaks, I can explain why

to send all the error messages in the program to the stderr(2).
there's a function called write_error in utils_built_in.c that takes 4 parameters:
the first 3 are strings to print in stderr, and the 4th is the int the fuction returns.

the fuction always frees the 2nd string sent to it so if you want to print 2 strings without freeing any you send like this : write_error(str1, NULL, str2, ret_int)

there's no other way to do it if we dont want leaks, I can explain why

2. same for CTRL \
2. dealing echo "'""'"
3. echo -n vrwvc>txt doesn't redirect

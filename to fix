TODO:
stop using ft_putstr_fd!!!
function that counts the number of single quotes and double quotes
function that give their position (to determine wether the quote is inside or not)
we don't want to run dollar_sign_check when the string is inside single quotes (echo '$HOME')
idea : whenever we encounter a dollar, we check if the string attached to the dollar sign exists in the env (echo $PATH). if it's in a double quote, we check until the closing double quote (echo "$P"ATH should check if $P exists. if not, remove $P and the quotes). if it's inside a single quote, don't run the replacing algo (echo '$HOME' only removes the quotes)
don't forger to add $? in the dollar_sign_check




when path is unset, don't forger to print "bash: env: No such file or directory" with error code 127, even when the function is unknown
when command is unknown and the path is set, "bash: cocou: command not found" error code 127
